Every working SenSitus/SVT revision should be tagged. That means not necessarily
only the distributed versions, but also internal test versions. The content in the cvs should be
checked in daily, but therefore the current CVS content might be not working.
Every week there should be an effort to create a version that is (at least somewhat) stable. These revisions should get their own tag.

"rev-0-90" stands for revision 0.90
"rel-0-95" stands for release 0.95

As - at least for now - Sculptor and SVT are linked very closely together, both should get
the same tags. If SVT is used more intensively also in other projects in the future, this might change.
